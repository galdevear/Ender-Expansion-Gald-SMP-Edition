FUNCTIONS:

	Hex - https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/hex_-now_loading-/
		Base pack, every function in 'far_end' namespace is 99% made by them. 
		I only did small alterations to apply small tweaks and changes.

	Cloud Wolf - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZnBqVITQ0dloqUU0fGxY3g
		Code in 'rng' namespace


WORLDGEN:
	
	Hex - https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/hex_-now_loading-/
		What did ya expect here?

	_humanoid - https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/_humanoid/
		Luminous End and Un-Luminous End were an inspiration for me.
		Also, Humanoid is doing a compatibility patch for both packs, so <3
	
	Misode - https://github.com/misode
		Their generators (https://misode.github.io/) have helped me a lot with development.
		Especially the Upgrader, which has done like 40% of my tasks for me!

	Starmute - https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/starmute/
		Nullscapes was also a giantic inspiration, this one for more
		barren biomes.
		Also, the Snow Layers in Frosted Hills are from their pack - Terralith.




ADVANCEMENTS:

	Misode - https://github.com/misode
		Yeah, I used Misode's generators to create Advancements as well...
	
	Cavinator1 - https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/cavinator1/
		'BlazeandCave's Advancement Pack' has been an inspiration for
		like 20% of the Advancements in this pack.
		You can clearly see it at some places xD (here read: 'Portable Storage')
		



PREDICATES:

	Misode - https://github.com/misode
		At this point you know what I would write there...

	UltroGhast - https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/ultroghast/
		Their 'Random Choices and Possibilities' Data Pack made creating chance-based
		features way more doable
